# DrivingWebsite

Welcome to drivingaid.co!

This project was initiated for a Hackathon (NwsHack 2022). We participated in a team of 2. Myself, Bryan Yang and Kyle Ah Von. 
This is our first attempt at a fully operational website using HTML, CSS and Javascript. There are no separate JavaScript files. They are embedded inside of 
the HTML files as scripts. 

The website aims to help people with driving anxiety or those who are new drivers to get a bit more accustomed to real-life situations. We took pictures of busy
intersections and created a quix style website. Javascript was primarily used for randomizing scenarios and checking right answers.

Below are some of the tasks and scenarios that the website will display. 

TO DO:

- crahses after 5 iterations
- move the start button on the scenarion pages
- add button that clears local storage on the 5th iterartion and sends back to home pages
